# Tutteli gradle plugin
A gradle plugin which provides utility tasks and functions which I often use in my projects.

You want to use it as well and need some examples? <br/>
Please [open an issue]((https://github.com/robstoll/tutteli-gradle-plugin/issues/new)), I might take the time to write some or point you to an existing project.
